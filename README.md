Instructions: 
I tested and compiled/ran this code using Google Colab - simply click the run button within Colab. For this project, Colab was using Python version 3.7.15. Additionally, it is important to note that in order to run this code, you must be able to enter valid credentials for an elevated Twitter Developer account (I had these files saved in a txt file that I would upload each time I ran the program). NOTE: I wasn't sure whether to submit the .ipynb file or the .py file so I included both of them.

The main functionalities of this program is to retrieve basic information about a list of Twitter users using Tweepy. For each user, it will show the user name, screen name, user ID, location, description, number of followers/following/tweets, and the URL. Additionally, it will show a list of each user's (bidirectional) friends as well as their first 20 followers. It will also collect the first 50 tweets containing the keywords 'Ohio' and 'weather', as well as the first 50 tweets originating from the Dayton region. Finally, it will deliver a feed of 25 tweets about Dayton basketball if it is 4 PM EST on a day where the Dayton Flyers Men's Basketball team plays.
